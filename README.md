# diy cloth mask

purpose:  to promote the interest of making cloth mask for own use or as a hobby among communities.  Encourage various individual creativity of design ideas.   

Because of inevitable nature in diy cloth mask on lack of specification, testing, quality control and choice of material, the effectiveness would not be in anyway ascertained and hence its purpose should not include serious usages including in clinical environment, in care home or other in other situations where certain reduction or prevention of virus transmission are expected. 

criteria of design:  1) use cloth, 2) with or without elastic, 3) with or without sewing machine.  

The files in this project include:

1.  masks design - [pleat type v1] - they are inkscape svg file and pdf file incorporating the material and process in making the mask
2.  masks examples - [pleat type v1]  - they are photos relating to the desing

Current issues to be resolved:

1. take too long to sew pleats on either side when more than two layers of fabric are used and they are folded three time in each sections of pleat.

2. expecting lack of elastic band in the future.  use of cloth tie and fasten tie at the back of the head is clumsy for some users.  Try to use knots like tautline hitch (midshipman)  but difficult to unfasten and release.
